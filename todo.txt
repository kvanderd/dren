TODO LIST:

1. Generalize the _question.erb partial for other types of decks. 
      
      a. This will involve modifying the partial. [DONE]

      b. Store the whole question in the Card object. (i.e. not just "California", but "What is the capital of California?".

2. Add commentary on answers based on guess (say whether they got it right! or wrong!). I think this will involve adding some logic into the post '/rounds/submit_guess' route that tells the _answer.erb partial whether the guess was right or wrong and that partial needs to display a message accordingly. [DONE]

3. Add more stats to profile page (total card looked at, overall correct %, etc.) [DONE]

4. Add another deck or two

NICE TO HAVE LIST:

1. Refactor where possible

2. Add overall css niceties [COULD BE IMPROVED STILL]

3. Show round stats immediately at end of each round. This may involve redirecting to a stats page at the end of the round (see the ajax where the final redirect happens).

4. Use jquery to make the transitions sexier between cards. Perhaps we could add an additional class to the question/answer partials that makes those dom elements hidden when they first load (using css), than we could fade them in or something using jquery's .show method.
